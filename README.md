# Wikipedia-API-Reactjs
he Wikipedia API is a web service that allows you to access certain wiki features, such as fetch information.According to fetch Albert Einstein from Wikipedia I need to call this API. In order to get data in multiple languages, I need to use a partial subdomain and pass appropriate parameters.


Some Parameters needed to fetch data from the Wikipedia API.
1.Axios
Axios is promise-based, easy to use, and we can take advantage of async and await. We can also intercept and cancel requests and have built-in client-side protection against cross-site forgery requests. To get the data from the Wikipedia API, I use Axios, which is one of the best HTTP clients for the browser and Node.js.
