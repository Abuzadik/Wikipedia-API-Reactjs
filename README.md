<h4> Axios</h4>
Axios is promise-based, easy to use, and we can take advantage of async and await. We can also intercept and cancel requests and have built-in client-side protection against cross-site forgery requests. To get the data from the Wikipedia API, I use Axios, which is one of the best HTTP clients for the browser and Node.js.
